## Summary
FIREFinance (PLACEHOLDER - name to be determine) is a social platform for anyone who wants to take their finances to the next level. Whether you are a beginner or an expert about all things finance, this platform is here for you to share your journey to financial freedom.
The application is targetted towards 18 - 45 year olds, as based on own observations, that is the age range where people will tend to care about/know about FIRE. The application was born out of my desire to track my finances and have a centralized place
where I can see where is my money flowing, along with tracking my goals and if I am on target. Currently, there isn't a unified/easy way for people to track their finances, often relying on spreadsheets or clunking software with subscription models.

This project will combine both the tracking of your finance with the social aspect of today's world. We will have a dedicated forms/post feature where uses can post their stories about their journey towards finance independence.
