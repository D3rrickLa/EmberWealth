# EmberWealth
Track your trades while also interacting with a community of people dedicated to the FIRE movement


## Core Fetures
- Track your finances (trades, savings, etc.) ðŸŸ¨
- Easy to use interface - importing/adding in your trade information
- Forums -> think Reddit, people can post stuff on the website about their journey (Blossom + TradingView)
- Chatting -> DMs basically
- web first, then mobile
- basic portolio breakdown (what stocks you have/the precentage) ðŸŸ¨

## Preimum Features (I.E. down the road, but keep in mind)
- modelling, Quant model of how your model will perform over N years
- boosting engagement, make your forums/post stand out more
- Portfolio Visualizer like feature
- Comparing your portfolio to other models (basic indexes and users - if allowed)
- comprehensive portfolio breakdown (overall portfolio and by account type (TFSA, Non-Reg, etc.)
- exclusive content (users with premium can make premium post for premium users only)


## Other things to consider
- educational content
- partnerships with other financial institutions for the data
- a mobile app will be nice
- SHORTS content, some way to implement this will be cool
- LinkedIn daily games?

  
## CORE PRINCIPLES
- community-centric approach (user feedback will dedicate where the app goes forward. What is good, and what to improve)
- move fast, but not reckless on impelmentation (Run, but not into on-coming traffic just to make it to the other side a bit faster)

## Tech Stack
### Backend
- Spring Boot -> Requests via GraphQL and internal services through GRPC
- PostgreSQL for DB
- Redis for caching popular post


### Frontend
- Angular for webapp
